    "__Hard-negative mining__ is one of __sampling method__ that is usually used in object detection task. The hard-negative sample means __difficult__ negative data like not high distance value but it is negative samples. Therefore, the hard-negative mining pick first hard-negative samples.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In near-duplicate image retrieval task, it means that the method firstly choose the hard-negative pair. As a representative example, following paper used this method.\n",

    "In above paper, they have to use Mir-Flickr 1M dataset which contain one million images. Generally, when we solve the ndir task by agglomeraive hierachical clustering algorithm, we have to use very big memory space, and also it takes at least $O(n^3)$ time complexity. Although we use parallel computing, that cannot be implemented. First of all, we can substitute clustering to binary classification task to solve clustering problem. If there are $n$ numbers of data, it can be $n \\choose 2$ numbers of pair which can be classified to ND or NND. If that is ND, it can be 1, or not 0. Following paper used this method.\n",
